# TODO
- Fixup the sample chain gain settings so they're easier to understand (not being translated properly for humans atm).
- Sort out CLI optional arguments via CLAP.
- Make the code more idiomatic / 'clean' / optimised.
- Cross-compilation / CI builds on Windows 10/11 and macOS.
- Consolidation:
  - Audio files from a Project into a Set's Audio Pool.
  - Audio files from a Set Audio Pool into a Project (only get what is needed).
  - Audio files from all Project into a Set Audio Pools.
  - Audio files from all Set Audio Pools into Projects.
- Handle AIFF files (and switching between AIFF and WAV within the code -- probably needs an abstraction).
- Inspect RIFF header issues with `hound` on samples from mars files
- Sane Logging messages
- Sane Error handling
- CI release builds ($$$$)
- Improve test coverage and test cases (negative tests).
